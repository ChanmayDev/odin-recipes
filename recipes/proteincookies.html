        <h2>Organic Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
        <p>These are delicious protein packed cookies.</p>
        <p>Made with a few simple ingredients you probably already have in the pantry.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of organic peanut butter. (You can substitute for any nut butter you like).</li>
            <li>1 cup of coconut sugar. (You can substitute for any sweetener you like).</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 scoop of protein powder. (In my exerience the flavor of protein powder didn't change it much).</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of organic dark chocolate chips. (You can use milk chocolate chips of course!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab a bowl, and add everything to your bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix it all together with a mixer.</li>
            <li>Once everything is combined, roll it into a ball.</li>
            <li>Separate that ball into two balls.</li>
            <li>Separate those two balls into halves, now you have four balls.</li>
            <li>Keep halving each ball until you have enough cookie-sized balls.</li>
            <li>Place on a pan at least an inch apart.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.</li>
            <p><em><strong>Enjoy!</strong></em></p>
        </ol>
